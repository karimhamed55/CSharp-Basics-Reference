# 🧠 C# Basics Reference – by Karim Hamed

Welcome to my personal C# learning repository!

This project contains a **heavily commented and structured C# script** that covers the core fundamentals of the language. It's designed to be a **self-study resource**, with clear examples and detailed explanations to make every concept stick.

## 🧭 Why I Built This

I’m using this script as a **living document** of my C# learning journey — and sharing it publicly to:
- Reinforce my own understanding
- Help other beginners follow along
- Serve as a reference for when I build future projects

## 💡 How to Use This

You can:
- Fork it and tweak it
- Study from it section-by-section
- Use it as a warm-up when switching between languages
- Apply concepts directly to your projects

> ✍️ Every section is written with clarity and in my own words so I can explain it confidently — feel free to do the same with your own twist!
